# HamLott 
### An automated Hamilton lottery app for San Francisco.  
### *UPDATE*: As of April 30, 2017 or so, SHM made the lottery entry pretty much robot-proof, and this app does not work with the current site.

License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

## Usage

HamLott is meant to enter *one email address per day only*. Please do not use
this to enter multiple email addresses at once -- that would be against both the
spirit of the lottery and the spirit of this app. 

## Success Rate

The author entered the lottery once per day from April 1, 2017 until SHM
prevented this app from working. During that time the author won the lottery
exactly zero times.
