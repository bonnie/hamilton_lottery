# HamLott ### An automated Hamilton lottery app for San Francisco.  *UPDATE*: As
of April 29, 2017 or so, SHM made the lottery entry pretty much robot-proof, and
this app does not work with the current setup.

## Usage

HamLott is meant to enter *one email address per day only*. Please do not use
this to enter multiple email addresses at once -- that would be against both the
spirit of the lottery and the spirit of this app.
